Position properties

1. static
  The Element is positioned according to the normal document flow.
Characteristics:
  Elements are not affected by top, right, bottom, or left properties.
  The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the page (default behavior).
Use case:
  Used when you don’t want to change the default positioning of an element.

2. relative
  The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
Characteristics:
  Setting top, right, bottom, or left will adjust the element’s position relative to where it would normally be.
  The space for the element in the normal document flow is preserved.
Use case:
  Useful for slight adjustments while keeping the element’s original space in the document.

3. absolute
  The element is positioned relative to its nearest ancestor with a position other than static.
  If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (often the viewport).
Characteristics:
  The element is removed from the normal document flow, so it does not affect the positioning of other elements.
  top, right, bottom, and left are used to position the element.
Use case:
  Used when you want to position an element independently of the document flow.


4. fixed
  The element is positioned relative to the browser window, so it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
Characteristics:
  Like absolute, the element is removed from the normal document flow.
  top, right, bottom, and left are used to position the element relative to the viewport.
Use case:
  Commonly used for elements like navigation bars or back-to-top buttons that need to remain visible at all times.

5. sticky
  An element with position sticky is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
Characteristics:
  Acts like relative until the element reaches a defined position (via top, right, bottom, or left).
  Once the specified position is reached, the element sticks in that position as the page is scrolled.
Use case:
  Useful for headers or sidebars that need to stay visible when a user scrolls past a certain point.

HTML5 Elements and Semantic HTML:

Header: Represents the header of a section or page, often containing navigational links, logos, or headings.
<header> </header>

Nav: Represents a section of navigation links.
<nav> </nav>

section: Defines a section of content that is thematically related, typically with a heading.
<section> </section>

Article: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
<article> </article>

Aside: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as a sidebar or pull quote.
<aside> </aside>

footer: Represents the footer of a section or page, typically containing copyright information, links, or contact details.
<footer> </footer>

Main: Represents the main content of a document, typically excluding sidebars, footers, and headers.
<main> </main>

figure: Represents self-contained content, such as illustrations, diagrams, or photos, often with a caption.
<figure> </figure>

<details> and <summary>
<details> is used to create an interactive widget that users can open and close. <summary> is a summary or label for the <details> element.
<details>
    <summary>More info</summary>
    <p>This is additional information.</p>
</details>

Semantic HTML:
Semantic HTML is the practice of using HTML5 elements according to their intended meaning, rather than just for presentation purposes. It enhances the structure and accessibility of web content.

Benefits of Semantic HTML:
Accessibility: Screen readers and assistive technologies can better understand the structure and purpose of the content, making it more accessible to users with disabilities.

SEO: Search engines can better index and rank your content because they understand the structure and context provided by semantic elements.

Maintainability: The code is easier to read and maintain, as the structure and purpose of the content are clear from the element names.

Standards Compliance: Using semantic HTML ensures that your code adheres to web standards, making it more future-proof.

Using semantic HTML helps to structure content logically, making it more meaningful and accessible for both users and search engines.
